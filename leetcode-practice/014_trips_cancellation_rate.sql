Problem: Trips Cancellation Rate

Description:
Compute the daily cancellation rate of taxi trips where both client and driver are unbanned.
Cancellation rate = (number of canceled trips) / (total trips with unbanned users) for each day.
Consider trips between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03" with at least one trip.

Tables:
Trips(id, client_id, driver_id, city_id, status, request_at)
Users(users_id, banned, role)

Example:
Trips:
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id | status              | request_at |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+
| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |
| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |
| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |
| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |
| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |
| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |
+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+

Users:
+----------+--------+--------+
| users_id | banned | role   |
+----------+--------+--------+
| 1        | No     | client |
| 2        | Yes    | client |
| 3        | No     | client |
| 4        | No     | client |
| 10       | No     | driver |
| 11       | No     | driver |
| 12       | No     | driver |
| 13       | No     | driver |
+----------+--------+--------+

Output:
+------------+-------------------+
| Day        | Cancellation Rate |
+------------+-------------------+
| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |
| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |
| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |
